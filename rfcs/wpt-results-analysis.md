# RFC 106: Move wpt.fyi metrics generation into the WPT org

## Summary

Move https://github.com/Ecosystem-Infra/wpt-results and https://github.com/Ecosystem-Infra/wpt-results-analysis into the web-platform-tests GitHub org.

## Details

The following metrics on wpt.fyi are generated by wpt-results-analysis:

- Browser Specific Failures
- Compat 2021
- Interop 2022

wpt-results-analysis depends on wpt-results, a highly compressed form of all full wpt.fyi runs ever, currently ~52k stored in a ~385M Git repository. This makes it possible to load thousands (or all) runs into memory at the same time, speeding up metrics generation.

## Risks

wpt-results-analysis depends on nodegit, which only works on Node.js 14.

## Alternatives

We could merge the metrics generation code into the wpt.fyi repository, but the wpt-results would still need to be standalone.
