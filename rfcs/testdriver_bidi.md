# RFC 182: Add WebDriver BiDi support to testdriver.js
## Summary
Add “testdriver.js” support for [WebDriver BiDi](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver-bidi/) events and actions. To support WebDriver BiDi, the following parts are required:
* **Wptrunner support for asynchronous actions.** WebDriver BiDi commands are asynchronous. To implement them, the test runner must support asynchronous actions. It should support concurrent actions as well. This means all async actions can be concurrent.
* **Wptrunner - testdriver transport support for events.** WebDriver BiDi events can be sent from the browser to the client. In order to support WebDriver BiDi events, wptrunner should be able to send events to testdriver.
* **Extend testdriver API.** Testdriver should be extended to support WebDriver BiDi commands and events.
* **Update RFC policy.** In [RFC policy](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/blob/master/README.md) do not require RFC for changes extending “testdriver.js” with a method that closely matches a [WebDriver BiDi](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver-bidi) protocol.
## Background
The “testdriver.js” framework (or testdriver for simplicity) is based on the one-directional WebDriver Classic protocol and lacks the ability to receive events from the browser via wptrunner, limiting our ability to test event-based functionalities such as console events in WPT (e.g. many [console log tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/tree/master/console) are [manual](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/console/console-timing-logging-manual.html)!). To overcome this limitation, this RFC proposes using the [WebDriver BiDi](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver-bidi) protocol, an extension for WebDriver Classic offering bidirectional communication between the test and the browser.
This document presents changes in testdriver and wptrunner so that it incorporates both WebDriver Classic and WebDriver BiDi functionalities, demonstrating the addition of tests for console events as an [example](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/44649).
## Details
### Glossary
* **testdriver**: “testdriver.js” framework used by tests and providing a way to communicate with the browser via wptrunner.
* **wptrunner**: backend python scripts implementing test harness, providing communication between testdriver and browser.
* **test harness**: communication channel between testdriver and wptrunner.
### Example
Here is an [example](https://github.com/sadym-chromium/wpt/blob/sadym/testdriver-bidi/console/console-log-logged.html) of a test using the proposed `test_driver.bidi` API for testing console log events.
```javascript
promise_test(async (test) => {
    const some_message = "SOME MESSAGE";
    // Subscribe to `log.entryAdded` BiDi events. This will not add a listener to the page.
    await test_driver.bidi.log.entry_added.subscribe();
    test.add_cleanup(async function() {
        // Unsubscribe from `log.entryAdded` BiDi events.
        await test_driver.bidi.log.entry_added.unsubscribe();
    });
    // Add a listener for the log.entryAdded event. This will not subscribe to the event, so the subscription is
    // required before. After the event is received, the subscription will not be removed, so the cleanup is
    // required.
    const log_entry_promise = test_driver.bidi.log.entry_added.once();
    // Emit a console.log message.
    console.log(some_message)
    // Wait for the log.entryAdded event to be received.
    const event = await log_entry_promise;
    // Assert the log.entryAdded event has the expected message.
    assert_equals(event.args.length, 1);
    const event_message = event.args[0];
    assert_equals(event_message.value, some_message);
}, "Assert log event is logged");
```
### Required changes
The proposal changes the following parts:
#### Testdriver
The testdriver requires support of event processing, and exposing it as an API.
##### Testdriver API
Introduce a new namespace `bidi` to the `test_driver`, and to `test_driver_internal`. The namespaces will be divided into separate WebDriver BiDi modules like in the [example](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/44649/files#diff-1fe2b624679a3150e5c86f84682c5901b715dad750096a524e8cb23939e5590fR54): `test_driver.bidi.{module}.{event/action}`.
###### Alternative
[Expose raw WebDriver BiDi protocol to `test_driver`](#expose-raw-webdriver-bidi-protocol-to-test_driver).
###### Actions
The BiDi actions are functionally equivalent to the classic actions. They are placed in the `test_driver.bidi.{module}.{action}`. In order to prevent action name clashes with the classic ones, action names (those used to communicate to the wptrunner) should have a form of `bidi.{module}.{action}`.
###### Alternative
[Flatten bidi and classic actions in `test_driver`](#flatten-bidi-and-classic-actions-in-test_driver).
###### Events
The exposed events API in `test_driver` provides the following methods for each event:
* `test_driver.bidi.{module}.{event}.subscribe(): Promise<void>`. The async method subscribes to the given WebDriver BiDi event, but does not add event listeners yet.
* `test_driver.bidi.{module}.{event}.unsubscribe(): Promise<void>`. The async method unsubscribes from the given WebDriver BiDi event.
* `test_driver.bidi.{module}.{event}.on(handler: (event)=>void): ()=>void`. The method makes the handler be called each time the event emitted. The callback argument is the event params. It returns a handle for removing this listener.
* (optional) `test_driver.bidi.{module}.{event}.once(): Promise<event>`. Creates a listener and returns a promise, which will be resolved after the required event is emitted for the first time. Removes the listener after the first event. This method is not required, but allows easier writing of some tests (e.g. it is used in the example above). It can be easily implemented via the `on` method. Note: this wrapper does not unsubscribe from the event.
###### Alternatives
* [Make generic event emitting in testdriver](#make-generic-event-emitting-in-testdriver).
* [Expose generic  `session.subscribe` method in `test_driver` instead of `test_driver.bidi.{module}.{event}.subscribe()`](#expose-generic--sessionsubscribe-method-in-test_driver-instead-of-test_driverbidimoduleeventsubscribe)
* [Do not expose `test_driver.bidi.{module}.{event}.subscribe()`, do it silently in the `on` method](#do-not-expose-test_driverbidimoduleeventsubscribe-do-it-silently-in-the-onmethod)
* [Use `EventTarget`-like events API](#do-not-expose-test_driverbidimoduleeventsubscribe-do-it-silently-in-the-onmethod).
##### Event processing
The proposal extends the event processing implemented in [`testdriver-extra.js`](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/tools/wptrunner/wptrunner/testdriver-extra.js) with a new message type [“testdriver-event”](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/44649/files#diff-46aeeb40b0a0c13031b151392ca70a17614295533d3e890c0cb4360cb3b91542R43). This message is sent by the wptrunner to notify the testdriver about new events. It uses the `message` field to store JSON-serialized `params` and `method`. The `testdriver-extra.js` script overrides `window.test_driver_internal.bidi.{modules}.{event}` object methods `subscribe`, `unsubscribe`, and `on`.
#### Wptrunner
Currently, the wptrunner processes communication with the testdriver in a blocking way, which makes it impossible to process events from the browser. To overcome this limitation, support of coroutines should be added.
##### Introduce `async_actions`
Analogous to `actions`, introduce an async_actions which will support asynchronous implementations (e.g. [`BidiSessionSubscribeAction`](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/44649/files#diff-9d6d3e870d033b8bc4d75b388fcc11dcf332e0293c286b2d57734c74e22020f7R4)). These async actions will be processed by `AsyncCallbackHandler`.
##### Alternatives
* [Extend `CallbackHandler` to support async actions](#extend-callbackhandler-to-support-async-actions).
* [Extend testdriver - wptrunner transport with `async_action`](#extend-testdriver---wptrunner-transport-with-async_action).
##### Introduce `AsyncCallbackHandler`
Add a `AsyncCallbackHandler`, which is an extension of `CallbackHandler` with support for async actions. It requires an event loop, in which it will schedule the tasks. Async action processing is done in the same way as CallbackHandler is done, but in the dedicated task. This would not allow raising unexpected exceptions in wptrunner. Testdriver will still be notified about those unexpected exceptions. [Example](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/44649/files#diff-3de439d55203876d452599a1a14968409df69e5869b16918ceec378a6b3345a4R813) implementation.
##### Extend `WebDriverProtocol`
As long as WebDriver Classic and WebDriver BiDi share the session, the `WebDriverProtocol` should be able to set a `enable_bidi` flag when creating the session. Extend the class with the  `enable_bidi=false` flag, which will be overridden by `WebDriverBidiProtocol`.
##### Introduce `WebDriverBidiProtocol`
The specific protocol implementation would be required to opt-in for this protocol. Now it’s `EdgeChromiumDriverProtocol` and `ChromeDriverProtocol`.
###### Dependency on `WebDriverProtocol`
New [`WebDriverBidiProtocol`](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/44649/files#diff-e5a8911dd97e0352b1b26d8ce6ef0a92b25378f7c9e79371a1eb1b1834bc9a8dR568) should be introduced. It is an extension of WebDriverProtocol, but with additional BiDi-specific protocol parts, e.g. [`BidiEventsProtocolPart`](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/44649/files#diff-47192f72de48b834a50992ada793229686299b5165612c2d97af6811764514c7R325) and [`BidiScriptProtocolPart`](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/44649/files#diff-47192f72de48b834a50992ada793229686299b5165612c2d97af6811764514c7R358). In order to enable the bidi session, the inherited `enable_bidi` flag should be overridden to `true`.
###### Dedicated loop
To be able to process events from the browser and from the tests in the same time, the WebDriverBidiProtocol protocol should have a dedicated [event loop](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/44649/files#diff-e5a8911dd97e0352b1b26d8ce6ef0a92b25378f7c9e79371a1eb1b1834bc9a8dR577), which will be used by wptrunner to run async actions and process events in WebDriver BiDi transport.
###### Alternative
[Add `AsyncProtocolPart` with `get_loop` method](#add-asyncprotocolpart-with-get_loop-method).
##### Extend `TestExecutor`
In this example we consider changes in [`WebDriverTestharnessExecutor.do_testharness`](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/44649/files#diff-e5a8911dd97e0352b1b26d8ce6ef0a92b25378f7c9e79371a1eb1b1834bc9a8dL591). Other `TestExecutor` (`MarionetteTestharnessExecutor`, `SeleniumTestharnessExecutor`, `ServoWebDriverTestharnessExecutor`,
`WKTRTestharnessExecutor` etc) implementations should be done in the same way in order to support WebDriver BiDi.
###### Messages from testdriver to wptrunner
The communication channel between testdriver and wptrunner is set in the `do_testharness` method. Currently the messages from testdriver to wptrunner it is done via long poll by calling BaseProtocolPart.execute_async_script which is synchronous (async in the name indicates that the script is wrapped in a special way before sent to the browser), and blocks processing the event  loop in wptrunner, which in turn blocks the event processing while waiting for the next message form testdriver to wptrunner. To overcome this limitation, this RFC changes the wptrunner - testdriver communication channel to asynchronous non-blocking  [`BidiScriptProtocolPart.async_call_function`](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/44649/files#diff-e5a8911dd97e0352b1b26d8ce6ef0a92b25378f7c9e79371a1eb1b1834bc9a8dR761) if available.  `WebDriverBidiProtocol`’s event loop should be used for message processing. This behavioral change is done only for protocols supporting BiDi.
###### Processing asynchronous actions
If `WebDriverBidiProtocol` is available, wptrunner uses [`AsyncCallbackHandler`](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/44649/files#diff-3de439d55203876d452599a1a14968409df69e5869b16918ceec378a6b3345a4R791) with the `WebDriverBidiProtocol`’s event loop instead of the sync `CallbackHandler`.
###### Forwarding events from wptrunner to testdriver
If `BidiEventsProtocolPart` is available, wptrunner sets a callback via [`add_event_listener`](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/44649/files#diff-e5a8911dd97e0352b1b26d8ce6ef0a92b25378f7c9e79371a1eb1b1834bc9a8dR696) and forwards all the events to the testdriver.
###### Alternative
[Add `async_execute_script` to `BaseProtocolPart`](#add-async_execute_script-to-baseprotocolpart).
##### Introduce `BidiEventsProtocolPart` and `BidiScriptProtocolPart`
###### `BidiEventsProtocolPart`
To provide events from wptrunner to testdriver, the [`BidiEventsProtocolPart`](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/44649/files#diff-47192f72de48b834a50992ada793229686299b5165612c2d97af6811764514c7R325) implements [`add_event_listener`](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/44649/files#diff-47192f72de48b834a50992ada793229686299b5165612c2d97af6811764514c7R345). `TestExecutor` will subscribe and forward events to testdriver.
###### `BidiScriptProtocolPart`
[`BidiScriptProtocolPart`](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/44649/files#diff-47192f72de48b834a50992ada793229686299b5165612c2d97af6811764514c7R358) is required for implementing asynchronous poll messages from testdriver. It implements async [`async_call_function`](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/44649/files#diff-e5a8911dd97e0352b1b26d8ce6ef0a92b25378f7c9e79371a1eb1b1834bc9a8dR142) action.
###### Alternative
[Implement a generic `BidiProtocolPart`](#implement-a-generic-bidiprotocolpart).
## Risks
### Future changes in WebDriver BiDi protocol
The WebDriver BiDi protocol may still undergo specification changes that could impact WPT tests.
#### Mitigation
* **Add commands on-demand.** To reduce the effects of future changes to the protocol, actions can be added as and when required instead of preemptively including all possible actions in the testdriver API.
* **Keep the testdriver API minimally required.** By keeping the testdriver API as minimal as possible, the impact of future protocol changes can be further reduced, as fewer API changes will be required.
### WebDriver BiDi implementation differences
Different implementations of WebDriver BiDi may have variations that could potentially complicate its use within the context of the WPT tests.
#### Mitigation
Ensure the testdriver API is compliant with the specification by avoiding reliance on implementation-specific data and behavior.
### WebDriver BiDi events might not agree with some observable side effects
In certain tests, the observable side effects may not correspond entirely with the WebDriver BiDi events. One such instance arises when a `log.entryAdded` BiDi event occurs, which does not guarantee the display of the console message in the browser's developer tools. This can cause false-positive test passes if the BiDi event does not have observable behavior.
#### Mitigation
This risk has a low priority impact and should not impede the project's progress.
### Different WebDriver BiDi implementation status
The implementation of WebDriver BiDi may vary across different endpoints, which can lead to tests utilizing BiDi functionality failing for endpoints lacking the required test components.
#### Mitigation
Expanding testdriver with WebDriver BiDi shouldn't cause previously passing tests to fail. This is because any regressions would only occur due to new tests that utilize WebDriver BiDi encountering incompatible endpoints - a scenario explicitly excluded from regression consideration.
## Alternatives considered
The list of alternatives of different granularity levels:
### Expose raw WebDriver BiDi protocol to `test_driver`
In this alternative approach, the `test_driver` is directly exposed to the raw WebDriver BiDi protocol. However, this approach was declined because it would not support a gradual implementation of WebDriver BiDi. Additionally, it would rely on the specific endpoint implementation status of the WebDriver BiDi, which could lead to flaky tests in case of protocol changes. While this alternative provides ultimate flexibility, its API would become challenging to use and prone to incorrect usage.
### Flatten bidi and classic actions in `test_driver`
In this alternative, in testdriver actions, the new WebDriver BiDi methods are added directly to the root testdriver object instead of introducing a dedicated `bidi` namespace. This approach has both advantages and disadvantages:
#### Advantages
No need in introducing a new namespace, and continue using the established pattern of adding new methods.
#### Disadvantages
* Potential for name clashes: If a new WebDriver BiDi action or event has the same name as an existing WebDriver Classic action or event, it could cause conflicts.
* Harder to determine if a specific testdriver method requires WebDriver BiDi support: Developers may need to consult the documentation or code to determine if a particular method requires WebDriver BiDi support.
* Can be done later after WebDriver BiDi is widely adopted, the `test_drive`’s root-level methods can be silently shifted to use BiDi under the hood.
### Make generic event emitting in testdriver
In this alternative, `test_driver` exposes an `EventTarget`, or methods `addEventListener(type, listener)`, and `removeEventListener(type, listener)`. Test will be able to subscribe to any WebDriver BiDi event.
#### Advantages
This approach is more flexible, as there will be no need in adding support for each WebDriver BiDi event.
#### Disadvantages
The generic events subscription would allow using any text as an event name while subscribing, which would require being familiar with WebDriver BiDi protocol. Also it would make it possible for tests to rely on not implemented or browser-specific events.
### Expose generic  `session.subscribe` method in `test_driver` instead of `test_driver.bidi.{module}.{event}.subscribe()`
In this alternative, the `test_driver.session.subscribe` method is exposed in the testdriver API. This allows for more flexibility, as all the BiDi events are supported by default. This suggestion was rejected because the API is challenging to use. Test writers must be familiar with WebDriver BiDi, and there is a risk of [future changes in WebDriver BiDi protocol](#future-changes-in-webdriver-bidi-protocol), which is a concern.
### Do not expose `test_driver.bidi.{module}.{event}.subscribe()`, do it silently in the `on`method
In this alternative, the `test_driver.bidi.{module}.{event}.subscribe()` method is not exposed in the testdriver API. Instead, each `on` handler subscribes to the required event. The API becomes simpler, as test writers would not require care about the concept of WebDriver BiDi subscriptions at all. Nonetheless, this option was rejected because:
* Event enabling API in BiDi is done pre-session. Meaning if `event.on()` is called twice, and after that the first listener is removed, should the subscription be removed as well?
* The `once` handler cannot be implemented since subscription is an asynchronous process.
### Use `EventTarget`-like events API
In this alternative, an [`EventTarget`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget)-like API is exposed for BiDi events:
`addEventListener(type, listener, options)`.
Options:
* `once: bool` Optional. A boolean value indicating that the listener should be invoked at most once after being added. If true, the listener would be automatically removed when invoked. If not specified, defaults to false.
* `subscribe: bool` indicates if the subscription should be set, if not yet. Defaults to `true`.
* `removeEventListener(type, listener, options)`.
  Options:
  * `unsubscribe: bool` indicates if the subscription should be stopped. Defaults to `true`.

This API is more common. However, more workarounds are required for it to be used in tests. Also, the subscription handling is harder and less explicit. The alternative was declined in order to prioritize test driver ergonomics.
### Extend `CallbackHandler` to support async actions
In this alternative, the async actions are supported by `CallbackHandler`. This would require making a `CallbackHandler` of the event loop in order to schedule actions processing. The alternative is rejected, as it would require all other test executors to support event loops. No gradual implementation is possible, which increases risks while introducing this change. After the RFC is implemented, `CallbackHandler` can be deprecated in favor of `AsyncCallbackHandler`.
### Extend testdriver - wptrunner transport with async_action
In this alternative, the testdriver - wptrunner transport is extended with a special `async_action` type. Rejected, as testdriver should not be aware of the specific actions implementation. From the testdriver perspective all the actions are asynchronous.
### Add `AsyncProtocolPart` with `get_loop` method
Instead of exposing the event loop in the WebDriverBidiProtocol, add a dedicated `AsyncProtocolPart` protocol part, which exposes the loop via `get_loop` method. The alternative is rejected, as the event loop is not a part of the protocol, but rather an implementation detail.
### Add `async_execute_script` to `BaseProtocolPart`
In this alternative, the `BaseProtocolPart` should be extended with the async `async_execute_script` method. The alternative is rejected, as it requires significant and risky changes in the WebDriver Classic client. Brings the same risks as alternative [Extend `CallbackHandler` to support async actions](#extend-callbackhandler-to-support-async-actions).
### Implement a generic `BidiProtocolPart`
In this alternative, instead of adding protocol parts one-by-one, a generic `BidiProtocolPart` is introduced. Declined, as it would require all the protocol implementations to either support the full WebDrive BiDi protocol or not.
