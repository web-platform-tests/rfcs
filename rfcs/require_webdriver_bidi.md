# RFC 212: Introduce `require_webdriver_bidi` metadata tag

## Summary

To enable the [testdriver BiDi API](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/testdriver_bidi.md) for specific WPT tests, this RFC proposes a new metadata tag: `require_webdriver_bidi`. This tag, applicable to HTML and JS files, would let test runners choose between [**WebDriverProtocol**](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/9c76757f5332678f9952f6ccb3824f62d30eca1f/tools/wptrunner/wptrunner/executors/executorwebdriver.py#L644) and [**WebDriverBidiProtocol**](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/9c76757f5332678f9952f6ccb3824f62d30eca1f/tools/wptrunner/wptrunner/executors/executorwebdriver.py#L736), or leverage this metadata in implementation-specific protocol selection and bindings on the test bases. This approach does not require all the browsers to implement BiDi.

[Prototype](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/48622).

## Background

[RFC 185](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/testdriver_bidi.md) proposes adding BiDi support to  `testdriver.js`, which involves using [WebDriverBidiProtocol](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/9c76757f5332678f9952f6ccb3824f62d30eca1f/tools/wptrunner/wptrunner/executors/executorwebdriver.py#L736) instead of [WebDriverProtocol](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/9c76757f5332678f9952f6ccb3824f62d30eca1f/tools/wptrunner/wptrunner/executors/executorwebdriver.py#L644) for test runners that use the WebDriver protocol. However, this change could cause regressions in tests that don't use the testdriver BiDi API due to unintended side effects of the transport change. To address this, the `require_webdriver_bidi` flag will inform the test runner whether the given test requires the testdriver BiDi API, allowing the runner to choose the appropriate transport, if the default one does not support BiDi protocol parts.

If at a certain point all the browsers implement testdriver BiDi and enable it by default, this flag can be deprecated.

```

### Required changes

The `require_webdriver_bidi` property has to be passed from `SourceFile` through `TestharnessTest` to `Test`, where it can be consumed by specific test runners.

The `require_webdriver_bidi` property is a flag that indicates that the test requires testdriver BiDi API support. This property is used by the test runner to determine which tests to run and how to configure the test session.

> [!NOTE]  
> Not having that flag does not require implementation to restrict BiDi.

The `require_webdriver_bidi` property can be set in the test source file, either `.html` or `.js`. The [SourceFile](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/9395d384f5c69a9a3a7fc4de04249f77500b2d3f/tools/manifest/sourcefile.py#L503) object reads that property and passes it to the [TestharnessTest](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/9395d384f5c69a9a3a7fc4de04249f77500b2d3f/tools/manifest/item.py#L169) object. The `TestharnessTest` object then passes the `require_webdriver_bidi` property to the `Test` object.

The test runner can use the `Test`â€™s `require_webdriver_bidi` property to determine whether to enable BiDi support for the test. If the `require_webdriver_bidi` property is set to `true`, the test runner will create a session with BiDi support.

Even though the `TestExecutor` needs information about whether to activate BiDi or not at `connect`, which happens before the runner receives the test to run, the configuration can be done at the point [the browser is configured](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/48618/files#diff-0df24b5b583c460182e687f7dc7a6a79dd2cd3389bc4a96f48483f60fceb51f7R272). This data can be used later by the specific executor implementation to [decide which protocol to use](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/48618/files#diff-c2f15328bc1ddfa8fb93c09ae41651e2bcfdad4f257932263a3e92c3f8deffceR248).

In order to prevent [potential false-negative due to missing `require_webdriver_bidi` tag](#potential-false-negative-due-to-missing-require_webdriver_bidi-tag),  `WebDriverTestharnessExecutor` implementation should restrict using WebDriver BiDi actions, if the `require_webdriver_bidi` metadata is missing.

#### Alternatives

* [Add metadata to `.ini` files](#add-metadata-to-ini-files).

#### Lint rules

Some lint rules has to be added to verify is used correctly:
* It is unique per test file.
* It has the correct value (either `true` or `false`).

### Deprecating of the `require_webdriver_bidi` metadata tag

Expectations are that eventually all the implementations would support BiDi either via WebDriverBiDi, or via implementation-specific bindings. At that point, the `require_webdriver_bidi` metadata tag can be deprecated. This can be done by simply removing the tag.

## Risks

### Having metadata in the Test is not sufficient

`TestExecutor` needs information about whether to activate BiDi or not at `connect`, which happens before the runner receives the test metadata. This can be addressed by passing the data to implementation-specific `TestharnessExecutor` via the implementation-specific `BrowserSettings` and  like in the [example](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/48618/files#diff-0df24b5b583c460182e687f7dc7a6a79dd2cd3389bc4a96f48483f60fceb51f7R269).

### Potential false-negative due to missing `require_webdriver_bidi` tag

Some implementations can enable BiDi by default, while others would still need enabling it via `require_webdriver_bidi`. This could lead to false-negative test passes by the tests requiring BiDi but not having the `require_webdriver_bidi` tag. This risk can be mitigated by adding documentation describing the logic behind.

## Alternatives considered

### Add metadata to `.ini` files

In this alternative approach, the `require_webdriver_bidi` metadata would be added to the corresponding `.ini` file. However, this approach was ultimately declined because the `.ini` file metadata is primarily concerned with the expectations of the test run rather than the specific API requirements. On the other hand, the `require_webdriver_bidi` metadata is directly related to the test API itself.

### Extract testdriver BiDi API into a separate file

In this alternative, the testdriver BiDi API is extracted from testdriver. Include of the file is used as a marker to enable BiDi sessions. This alternative involves unnecessary indirections, and would require non-trivial tracking of nested includes. Separating the testdriver BiDi API from the main codebase adds complexity and maintenance challenges. It also requires careful tracking of nested includes to ensure accurate BiDi session enabling. A simpler implementation should be considered.

### Add `?feature=` query parameter to `testdriver.js`

Detailed explanation is in the [RFC 214](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/214).

Add a query parameter `?feature=bidi`. In this approach, instead of `require_webdriver_bidi` metadata, the query parameter on the included `testdriver.js` is used to indicate the test requires WebDriver BiDi. This parameter will be used by the test runner in order to decide if the given test requires WebDriver BiDi or not, and by `testdriver.js` in order to provide or not `bidi` API. This approach allows for adding more future features on-demand and to customize testdriver API based on the set of features. Also this approach addresses the risk of [potential false-negative due to missing `require_webdriver_bidi` tag](#potential-false-negative-due-to-missing-require_webdriver_bidi-tag).
